## GUI
### PLOTS
- **improve highlight**, it should represent current position of en extruder.
- **improve plots**, they should not be redrawn from scratch every time
- **make color-bar work**
- **improve measurements plot** by utilizing position to value mapping

### PRINTER CONTROL
- **printer controlling buttons should work**
- **add antenna zeroing-script**

### UX DESIGN
- **add tool pop-up** after measurement cycle is done
- **add path generator options** additional pop-pup window would be grand with some
user should be able to precisely set the measurement range  
- **better looking buttons** custom css for those, colors should be picked from system setting 
maybe some dark mode, but this one can be hard sometimes 


## ANALYZER DEVICE
- **Investigate faster measurement performing**
- **connected devices** scanner, that detects all devices connected to the pc

## PRINTER DEVICE
- **improve send and await** it should estimate time needed for completion of requested movement
